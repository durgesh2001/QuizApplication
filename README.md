This project is a backend system for a Quiz Application developed using Spring Boot. It uses PostgreSQL as the database and Spring Data JPA for efficient CRUD operations. The application provides RESTful APIs to manage quizzes, questions, and user interactions.

A key feature of the application is the ability for users to generate quizzes based on their preferences. Users can specify the number of questions and select a category, and the system dynamically generates a quiz tailored to those inputs. This makes the application flexible and user-friendly, suitable for various learning or testing scenarios.
